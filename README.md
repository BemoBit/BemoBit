# Git Light

A tool to generate a GitHub contribution history with a natural commit pattern.

## Features

- Creates a realistic commit history that appears as daily activity on GitHub
- Generates 1-8 random commits on weekdays
- Occasionally adds 1-3 commits on some weekends (40% of weekend days)
- Skips commits on other weekend days (60% of weekend days)
- Customizable date range for commit history

## Usage

### Basic Usage

Run the `generate_history.bat` file by double-clicking it or from the command line:

```
generate_history.bat
```

This will create a year's worth of commit history by default (from 1 year ago until yesterday).

### Custom Date Range

You can specify a custom date range using the `--start-date` and `--end-date` parameters:

```
generate_history.bat --start-date 2023-01-01 --end-date 2023-12-31
```

You can also specify just one of the parameters:

```
generate_history.bat --start-date 2023-01-01
generate_history.bat --end-date 2023-12-31
```

Dates should be in the format `YYYY-MM-DD`.

## Pushing to GitHub

After generating the commit history, you can push the repository to GitHub with:

```
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/YOUR_REPO_NAME.git
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main --force
```

Note: You may need to use `--force` when pushing to override GitHub's history.

## GitHub Badges

You can add badges to your GitHub repository to display various information. Here are some common badges you can add to your README.md:

### Basic Repository Badges

```markdown

### Custom Badges

You can also create custom badges using shields.io:

```markdown
![Custom Badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/LABEL-MESSAGE-COLOR)
```

For example:
```markdown

2. Copy the desired badge markdown code and paste it at the top of your README.md file.
3. For custom badges, replace `LABEL`, `MESSAGE`, and `COLOR` with your desired text and color.
